This project operates a robot arm that moves items from one conveyor belt to another. The factory is simulated in factoryIO and is the .factoryio files. The PLC ladder logic was writen in OpenPLC Editor, and the PLC was simulated in OpenPLC Runtime. The beremiz.xml and plc.xml are needed for OpenPLC editor. The .st are the structured text files which can be loaded into OpenPLC Runtime or edited in the editor. The latest .st file is the _scada which talks to ScadaBR through modbus.
